This is the direction for this build. Adopt it. Do not blend it with the layout you would have made anyway,
and do not redraw because it is unfamiliar: unfamiliar is the point. Redraw a slot only when it conflicts
with a stated brand constraint or needs an asset that does not exist, and say why in your report.

The parts of this sheet were written separately and will disagree in small ways. Settle every disagreement in this order:
**house rules** (including type no smaller than 13px and body text of 16px or more) → **the direction** (the idea, the composition habits, where the
one accent goes) → **the type system and the palette** (which face does which job, the five size steps, which colour is the ground and where the
accent goes) → **the hero blueprint** → **the section blueprints**. Under each blueprint below, "Adjusted for this page" lists where it disagrees.
In practice: take geometry from blueprints (columns, proportions, what sits where) and take everything else from above them. Map every size a
blueprint names onto one of your five type steps instead of adding a sixth. Use one button shape, one corner radius and one pair of page margins on
the whole page, whatever individual blueprints say. If a blueprint names a kind of typeface (a light serif, a heavy grotesk), use the dealt face.

## 1. The idea
Show everything at once, small, in order. The work is laid out like a photographer's contact sheet or an archive drawer: dozens of small frames in strict rows, with all text set at one small size. Nothing is featured, which is the point: the volume and consistency of the body of work is the statement, and the visitor does the choosing. It suits people and studios whose strength is range and output.

Before anything else, write one sentence in your notes: "On this page, <the subject's own material> becomes <the device>."
Fill the first blank from your inventory of what only this client has (its name and what it means, its street, its numbers, its
constraint), then put the nearest competitor in the sentence: if it still works, the idea is the category's, not the client's.
Then name the one live thing the visitor can do on the page (SKILL.md step 4).

## 2. Composition
The name, or one sentence about the work, sits at display size (6–9vw) across the top of the first screen, and the sheet begins directly under it, still inside the first screen. The first screen opens with three or four short blocks of small text across the top on a 12-column grid (who, what, where to reach them), all at 14–16px, and immediately below, the sheet begins: rows of thumbnails at a fixed height (90–140px) with their natural widths, 6–10px gaps, each project forming a run of four to eight frames preceded by its title in the same small text. The sheet fills the whole page width edge to edge with 16–20px margins. Hovering a run dims the others and shows that project's one-line description in a fixed position. A single enlarged frame may interrupt the sheet once per screen at four times the size.

## 3. Type — Archivo
A sturdy grotesque kept at regular weight even at 88px, so the page reads as composed rather than loud. Suits finance, infrastructure and research pages that need to look sober and current.

- Display: **Archivo** — weight 400 · tracking -0.02em · leading 1.0 · sentence case; never bold, inactive items fade to grey
- Text: **Archivo** — 400 for body, 600 for buttons and short emphasis · leading 1.5 · tracking 0
```css
:root {
  --step-small: clamp(0.8125rem, 0.79rem + 0.1vw, 0.875rem);
  --step-body: clamp(1.0625rem, 1rem + 0.25vw, 1.1875rem);
  --step-lead: clamp(1.25rem, 1.1rem + 0.7vw, 1.625rem);
  --step-head: clamp(2rem, 1.3rem + 3.2vw, 4rem);
}
```
One face. The name at display size on the first screen; everything else at one text size and one small size; hierarchy below the name comes from position and from a single brighter ink for titles.
The direction decides sizes and how many of them; the type system decides how this face is set. Where the two give different tracking or leading, use the values of the type system: they are tuned to this face.
The display size itself comes from the hero blueprint below.

## 4. Colour — Forest and lime
```css
:root {
  --bg: #0f1f10;
  --surface: #162a17;
  --ink: #ffffff;
  --muted: #9aa39a;
  --accent: #c6f19d;
  --accent-ink: #0f1f10;
  --field-1: #000000;  --field-1-ink: #ffffff;
  --field-2: #ffffff;  --field-2-ink: #0f1f10;
}
```
Forest green, black and white sections alternate, with forest green holding the most; photographs stay in moss greens and stone browns. Pale lime sits on small squares only, such as arrow buttons and the closing wordmark.
Black or white ground, so the thumbnails are the only colour.

## 5. Imagery
**The project has no photographs of its own yet.** First choice: **real pictures of the subject's world from the open collections**: its city and street in old postcards and photographs, an old map of the neighbourhood, its materials up close, its trade in engravings, museum objects of its kind (references/imagery.md §3). Start with `node C:/Users/User/.t3/worktrees/portfolio/t3-53ccf175/.agents/skills/design-taste-frontend/scripts/assets.mjs "scripting kernel"`, then queries from your inventory (its street, its materials, its trade's tools and history). Download what you use into the project with `--get` and credit every one on the page (`--credits` prints the footer line). They show the world around the client, never the client's own room, dish, product, person or team. Second, for what no honest picture exists of: draw the subject's own things in code, large, in one flat graphic language and the palette's real colours (its tiles, its windows, its objects; references/imagery.md §8). Third: the dealt photographs, only where an honestly generic picture fits (the sea, the weather, a material), never one a visitor could take for the thing itself and never an unrelated scene. One treatment for all of them. If this direction is built on photographs, plan the set before building (four to six pictures of one family) and reuse them at different crops and scales instead of finding or drawing a new picture for every slot; keep drawings as `<symbol>` + `<use>` or generate them with a small script so the page stays light. List every found picture (with its source and licence), every dealt photograph and every drawing that stands in for photography in your report.

Many images: at least 24 frames to make a sheet. They can be project photographs from the dealt set cropped to mixed ratios, or page captures of the work. Square corners, no captions on the frames.

**Floor (the inspector checks it):** at least four real pictures on the page, usually six to twelve; SVG drawings do not count. One moving picture where an honest clip exists: `node <skill>/scripts/assets.mjs --video "<query>"`, used as a muted loop with a poster frame. Whatever this direction says about pictures, it is carried out with real ones.

Photographs dealt for this build, from the "Architecture" set (structure, lines, bridges, facades and building interiors)
Order of preference for imagery: (1) the project's own photographs and product shots; (2) images you generate, if an image tool is
available; (3) real pictures of the subject's world found in the open collections (assets.mjs, downloaded and credited on the page);
(4) drawings of the subject in code; (5) these. They are real photographs (Unsplash licence, served by picsum.photos) of places, light and
texture. They are atmosphere, never a stand-in for a specific product, dish, person or interface. List the ones you use in your report so
they can be replaced.

The last two path numbers are width and height: request the exact crop you render (`/1200/1500` for a 4:5 portrait, `/2400/1350` for a hero) and
add `?grayscale` to desaturate. Use three to six of them, not all eight. Always set `width`, `height`, `alt` and `loading="lazy"` (not on the hero image).
Other sets that fit this brief: object-still, fog-and-quiet, hands-and-making, people — `node draw.mjs --photos <set>` prints one in full; `--photos list` shows all sets. Taking photographs from another set is your call and is not a redraw; keep them to one light and one treatment.

## 6. Hero — Text band, then sheet
A black or white field on a seven-column grid with 14px margins and 14px gaps. There is no display type: everything is set at one size, 16px, in one weight. The top band is plain text hanging from a line 20px below the top edge: the name in column one; one sentence on availability in column two; a list of five or six services from column three; a longer list of clients or awards from column five; and two links, profile and the single contact action, at the right end of column seven. Lists run one item per line. Below the lists about 300px of ground is left empty. At mid-height the sheet begins: one thumbnail per column, each the full column width (about 190px) at its natural ratio, top-aligned, with the project title in the text size above the first frame of each run of two to four frames. Rows continue below the fold with 40px between them. Frames have square corners and sit directly on the ground with no border and no caption on the image.

On a phone: The grid becomes two columns with 12px gaps. The name and the availability sentence take the top; services and clients sit side by side under them as two short lists at 15px. An 80px gap follows, then the sheet: two frames per row at natural ratios, each project title above its first frame. The contact action is a text link fixed bottom-right.
Headline: None at display size: the name is set at 16px with the rest of the text, and one sentence of up to 60 characters says what the person does.

Adjusted for this page:
- It names colours (black, white): map them onto this palette's roles (ground `--bg`, panels `--surface` and the fields, text `--ink`/`--muted`, the accent `--accent` on the primary action only).

## 7. Sections, in order
Each is a composition to rebuild with this project's content. Keep the geometry; change the subject. Re-order or drop a
section when the argument of the page needs it (see references/copy.md), never to fall back to a card grid.

### 1. work — One strip per project (strip)
The left 13% of the width is a `position: sticky` column holding the section name at 28px and, beneath it, two text filters at 15px, the active one in full ink. To its right each project is one horizontal strip of four to six images, all exactly 190px tall at their natural widths (`height: 190px; width: auto`), 8px apart, the last one cut off by the right viewport edge with `overflow: hidden`. Under each strip, one line at 13px spread across the strip's width: project name flush left, a three-word descriptor at the centre, the year flush right. 45px separate one strip from the next, so four projects fit on a 900px screen and ten make a page. Square corners; no captions on individual frames. Hovering a strip dims the other strips to 40% opacity. There is no heading beyond the section name in the rail.
On a phone: The rail becomes a single line above the list: section name left, filters right. Strips are 120px tall and each scrolls sideways on its own with `overflow-x: auto` and scroll snapping. The caption line keeps the name left and the year right; the descriptor is dropped.

Adjusted for this page:
- It fades text: anything a visitor reads, inactive items of a list included, is `--ink` or `--muted` at full strength (contrast 4.5:1 or more). The active item is told apart by `--ink` against `--muted`, weight or the accent, not by fading the rest.

### 2. about — Side facts, wide paragraph (table)
Two rows share one vertical line at 34% of the viewport width. Row one: in a 160px column at the left margin, three label and value pairs stack with 20px between them, each a label in the soft ink with its value beneath in full ink, all at 13px (founded, based in, team size). From the 34% line a five-line paragraph at clamp(20px, 1.7vw, 26px), leading 1.35, runs to 90% of the width. Row two starts 120px lower and repeats the logic for the record of the practice: one plain word at 13px at the far left (awards, press, clients), then from the 34% line two list columns, each 260px wide with a 64px gutter, at 13px with 10px between lines: name at the left, year at the right in the soft ink. No heading; the paragraph opens the section. Each list comfortably holds 6–12 lines. No photographs are needed.
On a phone: Everything aligns to the left margin. The paragraph comes first at 19px. The three label and value pairs follow as a two-column grid at 14px. The two record lists stack with 40px between them, each opened by its plain word in full ink.

### 3. contact — Sentence, portrait, two links (band)
One closing row of three elements hanging from the same top line, with open ground between them, on a 12-column grid. Columns 1–5: a sentence of 12–18 words at clamp(26px, 3vw, 44px), four lines, leading 1.1, saying what kind of enquiries are welcome; it is set as a paragraph and there is no separate heading. Columns 8–9: one small square portrait or photograph of the place, 150–170px, with square corners. Columns 10–12: a short question at 18px in medium weight, then 20px below it two underlined links stacked at 18px (the email address and one booking or social link), and beneath them a line at 14px in the soft ink with the city and the usual reply time. Columns 6–7 stay empty. The row has 160px of space above and 120px below. No form. On a dark ground the photograph is the only bright thing in the row.
On a phone: The sentence comes first at 7.4vw. Below it the portrait at 96px square sits at the left margin with the question and the two links to its right, top-aligned, in the remaining width. The city and reply-time line spans the full width beneath.

Adjusted for this page:
- It sets a sentence large over several lines: jurors read that as a long headline. Either cut it to a two-line headline at display size, or keep it a statement at 36px or less on three lines (24px, four lines on a phone).

### 4. footer — A single quiet line (strip)
No footer block at all. After at least 30svh of empty page ground, one baseline 30px above the bottom edge carries three items in the page's ordinary small text size (14–16px), the same size and weight as the navigation: at the left margin, what this is in three or four words; centred, two to five links separated by 24px of space; at the right margin, the year and a privacy link. Use a three-column grid (1fr auto 1fr) so the centre group is truly centred whatever the side lengths. No logo, no background change, no line above it, no columns. Links are in the full ink; the rest in the softer ink. If the page has a narrow text column, the three items may instead sit on that column's left edge as one wrapped line. The restraint only works if the page above has already made its invitation.
On a phone: Three short lines at 14px on the left margin with 8px between them: the description, the links on one wrapped line, then year and privacy. Links stay in the full ink. Leave 20svh of empty ground above and 24px below.

## 8. Motion — Index with preview
Rows of text are the navigation through the work; pointing at a row brings up its image in one fixed frame and dims the other rows. On touch screens each row shows its image inline instead. Fast and exact (about 240ms crossfade), no lag behind the pointer. Recipe: 'Index with preview, anchored to the row' in references/motion.md.
This is the signature move, the one loud moment. Around it the page still needs the rest of the motion layer (SKILL.md step 9): an entrance for the parts of every section, feedback on every control, and one moving picture. The inspector fails a page that barely moves. Recipes: references/motion.md.

## 10. Where the richness comes from
Density and order. The mass of small images forms a texture; the strict rows keep it calm.

## 11. How this direction goes wrong
With fewer than about 20 images it looks unfinished; choose another direction. Do not add a big headline above the sheet. On a phone the frames become two per row at a fixed height and each run scrolls sideways. Rows that run past the right edge read as clipped in screenshots and to most visitors: wrap the frames onto the next line, or end each row inside the grid.

## 12. Real references
Studied sites that work this way. Take the principle, never the specifics: no names, copy, images or signature assets of theirs.
- **Gil Huybrecht** (Awwwards Site of the Day, studied score 7.6) `aww-gil-huybrecht`
  Idea: A portfolio as a contact sheet: every project is a numbered run of miniature page screenshots on black, and all text is set at one small size.
  Hero: Black field on a seven-column grid with 14px margins. The top band is plain white text at one size, about 16px: name in column one, availability in column two, a services list from column three, a longer awards list from column five, then 'Profile' and 'Email me' at the right. List items are indented one step under their label. Below the lists roughly 300px of black is left empty. At mid-height the thumbnail grid begins: one small website screenshot per column, about 190px wide, each topped by a number at its right corner, with the project name over the first of each run. Two tiny toggle chips sit in the bottom corners.
  Worth taking: Set every piece of text on the page at one size and weight and build hierarchy only from column position and a one-step indent under labels.
- **Smallbits** (One Page Love, studied score 7.2) `opl-smallbits`
  Idea: The icon set is the page: a full-viewport wall of the product with one docked card holding every word.
  Hero: The whole viewport is a black field tiled with white pixel icons, each drawn about 50px on a 112px pitch, nine rows deep; alternate rows shift half a cell so it reads as a brick pattern, and icons at the edges are cropped. There is no header. A white square-cornered card, 795×170px, is docked bottom-centre: a two-line 24px semibold sentence left, a black rectangular button right, a row of five grey links below. A third-party badge floats top-right. This single screen is the entire page.
  Worth taking: Make the product the wallpaper: tile the full viewport with the assets at large size and skip a hero image entirely.
- **Artem Shcherbakov** (Awwwards Site of the Day, studied score 7.4) `aww-artem-shcherbakov`
  Idea: A director's reel hides behind a small pill-shaped window that scrolls open to fill the screen, while neon-green marker scribbles deface the polite typography.
  Hero: White page. Three nav words are pinned to the very top: one hard left, the name centred, one hard right, in bold condensed lowercase about 28px, touching the edges. The content is a single horizontal row at mid-height in three equal parts. Left: a two-line greeting in an ultra-heavy rounded sans at about 6vw, with a neon-green hand-scrawled word and underline drawn over it. Centre: a vertical rounded-rectangle window about 180 by 300px showing zoomed, pixelated video. Right: a green doodle face above a centred six-line bio at about 22px. A tiny grey scroll cue sits bottom-centre. More than 60% is white.
  Worth taking: Start the showreel as a small pill-shaped mask in the hero and let scrolling grow it to full-bleed.
Full notes on any of them: `node draw.mjs --site <id>`.

## Always
Headlines two lines or fewer at every width. No eyebrow labels, no monospace, no 01/02/03, no thin rules, no gradients, no shadows at rest,
no cream-and-terracotta, no violet. The frame: one h1 on the first screen that says what this is, equal outer margins, no
section huddled on one side with the other half empty, no blank stretch over half a screen, a heading on every section.
`inspect.mjs` measures all of it.
